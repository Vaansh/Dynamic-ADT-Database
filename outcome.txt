Sorted Sequence ADT based on arraylsit:
	Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
	Space Complexity: O(n)

AVL Tree ADT:
	Time Complexity: O(logn)
	Space Complexity: O(n)


IntelligentSIDC ADT uses a sorted sequence based on an arraylist for small (up to 1000), it is sorted using binary search algorithm.

Above 1000, an AVL Tree is used. This is because it is more efficient. IntelligentSIDC class calls methods accordingly.
